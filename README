# GNS3-VM

## Vagrant

First I started working on Vagrant and chose base image `generic/ubuntu2004` since it supports more providers than official `ubuntu/focal64`.

I created a provisioning script that installs everything needed to run GNS3:

- Add repos for GNS3 and Docker
- Install GNS3
- Install Docker
- Install Firefox
- Add user to groups
- Prepare gns3server to work as a daemon
- Configure and build Apache Guacamole

I got systemd init script for GNS3 server from here: https://github.com/GNS3/gns3-server/blob/master/init/gns3.service.systemd

For connection to the VM I decided to use Apache Guacamole for its simplicity and ease of use.
